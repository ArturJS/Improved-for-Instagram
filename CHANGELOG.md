# Changelog

## [2.7.2] - 2018-06-24

### Added

### Changed

- Notifications now arrive as long as you haven't watched the story (either in the app or online)

## [2.7.0] - 2018-06-20

### Added

- Huge new feature: You can now add Users to your list of "Watched Posts" and/or "Watched Stories" (found on the options page on the 3-dots page)!

  - How it works: You will get a notification whenever the User posts something, and/or adds a new Story

  - You can decide whether to get notified in background, or only if you open Instagram.com (latter is default)

  - The User(s) will have a badge on his profile, so you can recognize whom you are watching

- New Changelog page (can be accessed on the 3-dots page under "?")

  - It will open automatically, whenever something bigger has changed (so not when there's only bug fixes)
